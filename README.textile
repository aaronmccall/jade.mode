h1. jade.mode


jade.mode is a jade syntax definition for SubEthaEdit & Coda. This is a work in progress so please be patient ;) Suggestions and forks are greatly appreciated. Open an issue on this branch if you notice any problems.

h2. Usage

h3. Installation

Simply check out this repo into either <code>~/Library/Application Support/Coda/Modes</code> or <code>~/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes</code>, be sure to name the directory <code>jade.mode</code>.

h2. Known Issues

* Currently the syntax highlighting for multiline comments is somewhat wonky, though working in some cases. Suggestions are much appreciated, as I am not well versed in the SubEthaEdit regex engine!
